"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has allocated over 200 billion new dollars for K-12 education. This funding represents a massive investment in our nation's schools; spending it wisely will enable our students to thrive.

Research, experience, and simple logic shows that our best bet is to focus on the individual needs of each student - both academic needs and social-emotional needs. Teachers have valiantly helped their students transcend challenges related to the pandemic and independent of it; but, many students need a level of personal attention targeted to their specific needs that can rarely be delivered in a traditional classroom.

Well structured tutoring, what is commonly known as high-impact tutoring, delivers just this. When students build relationships with tutors in a high-impact tutoring program that complements classroom instruction, they show significant academic and social-emotional growth that benefits them as they move through school and beyond.

What is high-impact tutoring? It's not drop-in after-school homework help. Rather, it is one-on-one or small group tutoring, delivered at least three times a week by trained tutors using high-quality materials, ideally during the school day. This kind of focused program is effective, even for students who are far behind their peers academically. However, educators are currently overwhelmed with change and not all tutoring is effective."
